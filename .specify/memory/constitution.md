# Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development
All development must strictly follow spec-driven development methodology; No manual coding is allowed; All code must be generated by the AI agent based on explicit specifications; Every implementation step must trace back to the specification.

### II. Python Console Application
The application must be a Python console-based todo app; All user interactions occur through command-line interface; Clean, intuitive command structure required with proper help documentation.

### III. In-Memory Storage
All tasks must be stored in memory only; No database, no file storage allowed; Data persistence only exists during application runtime; Simple, lightweight implementation required.

### IV. Clean Architecture
Code should follow clean architecture and separation of concerns; Clear boundaries between business logic, application logic, and presentation layer; Maintainable, testable code structure required.

### V. Specification Compliance
Only features explicitly mentioned in the specification are allowed; No feature creep or additional functionality beyond stated requirements; Strict adherence to defined scope and requirements.

### VI. Minimal Dependencies
Use only standard Python libraries where possible; Minimize external dependencies to keep the application lightweight; Focus on core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack: Python 3.8+ with standard library only
Deployment: Single executable Python script or simple package
Testing: Unit tests for all business logic components
Documentation: Inline code documentation and basic user guide

## Development Workflow

Code generation: All code must be AI-generated based on specifications
Review process: Each implementation must be traced back to specification
Quality gates: All code must pass basic functionality tests before acceptance
Change management: Any deviation from specification requires explicit approval

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for this project; All amendments must be documented and approved; The project must maintain compliance with all stated principles; Code reviews must verify adherence to constitution requirements.
